# Adventure Game in Pygame & Python

This game is a tile-based 2D adventure game created with Pygame. The video for this step can be found here [Entities with Pygame - Adventure Game Part 3](https://youtu.be/zRKDARu3HWY).


## Quickstart

1. Open a terminal at the project location. In VSCode, go to the top where it says **Terminal**, and click **New Terminal**. If you don't see terminal, you may see three dots near the top left, click those and see if **Terminal** is under those.
2. Create a virtual environment. Run `python3 -m venv venv`. If you get an error, try `python -m venv venv`. If this still does not work, ensure [Python is installed on your system](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
3. Activate the virtual environment. **On MacOS, Linux and Unix**, run `source venv/bin/activate`. **On Windows**, run `venv/Scripts/activate`.
4. Install Pygame by typing `pip install pygame`.
5. Run the game by typing `python3 src/main.py`. If this doesn't succeed, try `python src/main.py`.
