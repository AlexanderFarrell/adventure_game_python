# Adventure Game in Python & PyGame

Would you like to build a 2D adventure game with Python and PyGame? This code is from a **free video series on YouTube** which you can watch to build a game like this step-by-step!

The playlist on YouTube for each step can be found here [Pygame - Adventure Game](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8cgfOA2qzeXxXe7DBWxX1UR5fJ4MDTb&si=BAjE1NPnPxDdv5rP).

## Quickstart

1. Open a terminal at the project location. In VSCode, go to the top where it says Terminal, and click New Terminal. If you don't see terminal, you may see three dots near the top left, click those and see if Terminal is under those.
2. Create a virtual environment. Run `python3 -m venv venv`. If you get an error, try `python -m venv venv`. If this still does not work, ensure [Python is installed on your system](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Activate the virtual environment. On MacOS, Linux and Unix, run `source venv/bin/activate`. On Windows, run `venv/Scripts/activate`.
4. Install Pygame by typing `pip install pygame`.
5. Run the game by typing `python3 src/main.py`. If this doesn't succeed, try `python src/main.py`.

## Using the Code in Your Own Games

You are absolutely allowed to use the code and assets from this game in your own games, even commercially, and even for closed source games you make, as long as you agree to the below license.

My goal is to help you in making your own games, and I hope this work can be of value to you.
