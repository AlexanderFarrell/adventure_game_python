All of the code for this project is located here.

The game starts with main.py, which imports in everything else. The code is separated into two parts: components and core. **Core** deals with code for various global parts of the game, such as the map, camera, and user input. The **Components** module contains components you can add to create objects in the game, such as Sprites, Bodies for physics calculations, and so forth.
